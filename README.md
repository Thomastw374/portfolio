# A portfolio: Thomas Whiteley - Trainee Software Developer

# This is a portfolio to show to employers. In the coming weeks I will add a number of projects to this portfolio to showcase my skills. It currently includes a bio but will soon also include information about my interests and experience.

# The portfolio also acts to show case my current skills with HTML, CSS and SCSS.
